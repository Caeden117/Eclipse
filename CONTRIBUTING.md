# Eclipse Contributing Guidelines

Eclipse, although a small project, is not immune to the common bug and issue. If that is not the case for posting, maybe an additional item, crafting recipe, tweak, or improvement to add on to Eclipse.

Whatever your case may be, these are some guidelines (*not rules*) for how to create useful contributions. Use judgement, and feel free to propose changes.

## Error/Bug Reporting

Before creating a bug report, search existing issues to see if your issue has already been reported and/or fixed.

**Creating A Good Bug Report:**

Bugs are tracked and submitted as [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Here are some guidelines on how to create a good bug report for us to solve and track down.

* **Be clear and descriptive** for the title and description.
* **Explain how you ran into this issue.** Be honest with this, even if you've modified your save file.
* **If you believe it was a save file issue,** attach your save file, copy the file in a Markdown code block, or create and link a [GitHub Gist](http://gist.github.com/).
* **If you can reproduce this issue,** provide steps to reproduce it with as much detail as possible. If you have a feeling your save file was part of it, see the guideline above.

## Suggestions and improvements

Suggestions, tweaks, or general improvements to Eclipse can help it become better. But some ideas will be suggested more then others. Before submitting a suggestion, please search and see if your idea has already been suggested and/or added.

**Creating Good Suggestions:**

* **Be clear** about your idea.
* **Be detailed as well.** If you're suggesting items, include specific details such as how much HP it'll restore, how much Infection it will give, etc.

(More to come lol)
