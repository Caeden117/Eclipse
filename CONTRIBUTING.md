# Eclipse Contributing Guidelines

Eclipse, although a small project, is not immune to the common bug and issue. If that is not the case for posting, maybe an additional item, crafting recipe, tweak, or improvement to add on to Eclipse.

Whatever your case may be, these are some guidelines (*not rules*) for how to create useful contributions. Use judgement, and feel free to propose changes.

## Error/Bug Reporting

Before creating a bug report, search existing issues to see if your issue has already been reported and/or fixed.

**Creating A Good Bug Report:**

Bugs are tracked and submitted as [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Here are some guidelines on how to create a good bug report for us to solve and track down.

* **Be clear and descriptive** for the title and description.
* **Explain how you ran into this issue.** Be honest with this, even if you've modified your save file.
* **If you believe it was a save file issue,** attach your save file, copy the file in a Markdown code block, or create and link a [GitHub Gist](http://gist.github.com/).
* **If you can reproduce this issue,** provide steps to reproduce it with as much detail as possible. If you have a feeling your save file was part of it, see the guideline above.

## Suggestions and improvements

Suggestions, tweaks, or general improvements to Eclipse can help it become better. But some ideas will be suggested more then others. Before submitting a suggestion, please search and see if your idea has already been suggested and/or added.

**When creating suggestions, be wary that:**
* Crafting recipes are limited to **one output**.
* Adding completely new mechanics will be difficult, and will take a lot of persuading to add them.
* Modding support is not planned but if needed it will be.
* Clearly overpowered stuff (High damage and durability but get it as a mob drop) will instantly be removed.

**Creating Good Suggestions:**

* **Be clear** about your idea.
* **Be detailed with what your Items will do.** If you're suggesting items, include specific details such as the minimum Intelligence to use it, what it'll do, the rarity of the item, how you'll come across this (Looting, hunting, crafting, etc.)
* **Want to add new crafting recipes?** Explain why you think it would work with the items you need and the item you'll get.
* **Maybe you want a whole new section of items and crafting recipes in Eclipse?** Tell us why you think these items should be added to Eclipse

(More to come lol)
