# Eclipse
A C# console-based game. Based off of an older project.

# In a nutshell...
Eclipse is a remake of an old project I had a year or two ago. Written in VB.Net, it was very rudimentary and had little advanced features. Eclipse fixes this, and with the magical power of C#, improves and adds more complex features.

# Old project? What old project?
Before Eclipse, I had created a similar project called DoomVB. The name was a VB.NET recreation of my friend's webpage-based game made during a summer camp. [Here's a link to the old files if you want to download DoomVB.](jackz.me/doom) I am no longer supporting this game, so any bugs that you encounter will *not* be fixed.

DoomVB expanded upon the old project and introduced concepts that would be redesigned into Eclipse.
