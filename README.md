# Eclipse
A C# console-based game. Based off of an older project.

# In a nutshell...
Eclipse is a remake of an old project I had a year or two ago. Written in VB.Net, it was very rudimentary and had little advanced features. Eclipse fixes this, and with the magical power of C#, improves and adds more complex features.

# Old project? What old project?
Before Eclipse, I had created a similar project called DoomVB. The name was a VB.NET recreation of my friend's webpage-based game made during a summer camp. [Here's a link to the old files if you want to download DoomVB.](jackz.me/doom) I am no longer supporting this game, so any bugs that you encounter will *not* be fixed.

DoomVB introduced and refined concepts like the console, item using, shop, and clans. Even an inventory was planned. But it wasn't realistic. You were limited to about 9 consumable items, a few weapons that only increased the number of enemies you encounter, and upgrades that made money grinding easy. Integer Overflows were common so lots of hard limits were added.

# Introducing Eclipse
Eclipse improves the concepts introduced and refined by DoomVB and makes them more realistic. A proper inventory system was added, along with weight, lots of more items, and crafting was also introduced. Inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, Eclipse introduced stats that impact aspects of the game.
