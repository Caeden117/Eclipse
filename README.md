# Eclipse
A simple C# console-based game. Based off of an older project.

# What is this?
A simple remake of an old project I had a few years ago. Written in VB.Net, it was very rudimentary and had little advanced features. Eclipse fixes this, and with the magical power of C#, improves and adds more complex features.
